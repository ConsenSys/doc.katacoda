Previewing your doc site you will help you to push your contribution with confidence.

What you see in the preview is exactly what you will have on the final documentation site.

When you do not need the preview to run anymore, simply stop it.

## Task

In the `template-docsite` directory, run `docker-compose down`{{execute}}

And you're done!

The preview service is now stopped and Docker containers are removed.

Congratulations, you made your first step with the ConsenSys Doctools!
