The first step is to fork a documentation repository.

Here you are going to clone the template repository.

For your own use case, you will have to clone your own doc repository.

## Task

Clone our template repository that contains the template documentation with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/ConsenSys/doctools.template-site.git template-docsite`{{execute}}

(Click on the command block to automatically execute it in the terminal)
