Now that you previewed your doc site, you will be able to push your contribution with confidence.

You do not need the preview to run anymore, so stop it.

## Task

In the `template-docsite` directory, run `docker-compose down`{{execute}}

And you're done!

The preview service is now down.

Congratulations, you made your first step with the ConsenSys Doctools!
